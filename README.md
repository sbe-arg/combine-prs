# combine-prs

A simple github action that combines multiple prs into one

## how this works

- you can select multuple prs to combine into one
- this pr works well paired with https://github.com/sbe-arg/simple-compose-service-updates when sometimes you have a a large number of prs created for each compose service

## how to use

- create [combine-prs.yaml](./.github/workflows/combine-prs.yaml) and place in your workflows.
- run manually from the action tab to combine prs
